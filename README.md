# Workout-tracker
Overview
Part of this project is to create a Workout Tracker using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema where users are able to track their most recent workout plan, and add new exercises. Users should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and the duration of the exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, users should be able to track the distance traveled.

Acceptance Criteria
The user should be able to:

Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.

View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
